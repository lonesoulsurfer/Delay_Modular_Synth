Adding delay to any synth can add fantastic depth to the sonic soundscape. This build uses an Arduino Nano to create a digtal delay that can be used on a modular synths or as it's own stand along synth. It's an easy build with minimal components needed and the finished module sounds great!

The original schematic (see below) had some additional features which I removed as they didn't sound great with my modular synth set-up.  I had to also make a change to the values of 2 capacitors connected to the input and output audio sockets as I was getting too much feedback.  This doesn't effect the delay at all and removes most if not all of the noise.

Just a quick note on my modular synth. The one that I built is a bit of a cheats version where most of the modules are powered by an Arduino Nano. It means that I don't have to worry about tuning, playing around with 1v/octave controlled voltages etc. Everything is always in tune and simple to use in my cheats modular synth :)

I've got a little space left in my current Eurorack to add another module which will either be a low pass filter or a sync in/sync out.
