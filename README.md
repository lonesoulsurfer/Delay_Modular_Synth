# Delay-Echo_Modular_Synth

Adding delay to any synth can add fantastic depth to the sonic soundscape. In this build I use an Arduino Nano to create a little module that can be used on a modular synths or as a stand along synth. It's an easy build with minimal components needed and the finished module sounds great!


Just a quick note on my modular synth. The one that I built is a bit of a cheats version where most of the modules are powered by an Arduino Nano. It means that I don't have to worry about tuning, playing around with 1v/octave controlled voltages etc. Everything is always in tune and simple to use in my cheats modular synth :)
